/**
@page test-suite libinput test suite

The libinput test suite is based on
[Check](http://check.sourceforge.net/doc/check_html/) and runs automatically
during `make check`. Check itself is wrapped into a libinput-specific test
suite called *litest*. Tests are found in `$srcdir/test/`, the test binaries are
prefixed with `test-` and can be run individually. 

@section test-config X.Org config to avoid interference

uinput devices created by the test suite are usually recognised by X as
input devices. All events sent through these devices will generate X events
and interfere with your desktop.

Copy the file `$srcdir/test/50-litest.conf` into your `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d`
and restart X. This will ignore any litest devices and thus not interfere
with your desktop.

@section test-root Permissions required to run tests

Most tests require the creation of uinput devices and access to the
resulting `/dev/input/eventX` nodes. Some tests require temporary udev rules.
<b>This usually requires the tests to be run as root</b>.

@section test-filtering Selective running of tests

Check enables tests to be grouped into suites and test cases, litest uses
test suites as a general feature-specific grouping (e.g. "touchpad:tap") and
instantiates one test case per device. The --list flag shows the list of
suites and tests.
@code
$ ./test/test-device --list
device:wheel:
	wheel only
	blackwidow
device:invalid devices:
	no device
device:group:
	no device
	logitech trackball
	MS surface cover
	mouse_roccat
	wheel only
	blackwidow
...
@endcode

In the above example, the "device:wheel" suite is run for the "wheel only" and
the "blackwidow" device. Both devices are automatically instantiated through
uinput by litest. The "no device" entry signals that litest does not
instantiate a uinput device for a specific test.

Check provides two filters through environment variables: <b>CK_RUN_SUITE</b>
and <b>CK_RUN_CASE</b>. They may be used independently or combined to narrow
down the set of tests to run. For example:

@code
$ CK_RUN_SUITE="device:wheel" ./test/test-device
$ CK_RUN_CASE="wheel only" ./test/test-device
$ CK_RUN_SUITE="device:wheel" CK_RUN_CASE="wheel only" ./test/test-device
@endcode

Check and litest currently do not provide a way to run a specific test
function only.
