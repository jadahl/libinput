/**
@page test-suite libinput test suite

The libinput test suite is based on
[Check](http://check.sourceforge.net/doc/check_html/) and runs automatically
during `make check`. Check itself is wrapped into a libinput-specific test
suite called *litest*. Tests are found in `$srcdir/test/`, the test binaries are
prefixed with `test-` and can be run individually. 

@section test-config X.Org config to avoid interference

uinput devices created by the test suite are usually recognised by X as
input devices. All events sent through these devices will generate X events
and interfere with your desktop.

Copy the file `$srcdir/test/50-litest.conf` into your `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d`
and restart X. This will ignore any litest devices and thus not interfere
with your desktop.

@section test-root Permissions required to run tests

Most tests require the creation of uinput devices and access to the
resulting `/dev/input/eventX` nodes. Some tests require temporary udev rules.
<b>This usually requires the tests to be run as root</b>.

@section test-filtering Selective running of tests

litest's tests are grouped by test groups and devices. A test group is e.g.
"touchpad:tap" and incorporates all tapping-related tests for touchpads.
Each test function is (usually) run with one or more specific devices.
The `--list` commandline argument shows the list of suites and tests.
@code
$ ./test/test-device --list
device:wheel:
	wheel only
	blackwidow
device:invalid devices:
	no device
device:group:
	no device
	logitech trackball
	MS surface cover
	mouse_roccat
	wheel only
	blackwidow
...
@endcode

In the above example, the "device:wheel" suite is run for the "wheel only" and
the "blackwidow" device. Both devices are automatically instantiated through
uinput by litest. The "no device" entry signals that litest does not
instantiate a uinput device for a specific test (though the test itself may
instantiate one).

The `--filter-test` argument enables selective running of tests through
basic shell-style function name matching. For example:

@code
$ ./test/test-touchpad --filter-test="*1fg_tap*"
@endcode

The `--filter-device` argument enables selective running of tests through
basic shell-style device name matching. The device names matched are the
litest-specific shortnames, see the output of `--list`. For example:

@code
$ ./test/test-touchpad --filter-device="synaptics*"
@endcode

The `--filter-group` argument enables selective running of test groups
through basic shell-style test group matching. The test groups matched are
litest-specific test groups, see the output of `--list`. For example:

@code
$ ./test/test-touchpad --filter-group="touchpad:*hover*"
@endcode

The `--filter-device` and `--filter-group` arguments can be combined with
`--list` to show which groups and devices will be affected.

@section test-verbosity Controlling test output

Each test supports the `--verbose` commandline option to enable debugging
output, see libinput_log_set_priority() for details. The `LITEST_VERBOSE`
environment variable, if set, also enables verbose mode.

@code
$ ./test/test-device --verbose
$ LITEST_VERBOSE=1 make check
@endcode
