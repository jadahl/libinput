libinput
========

libinput is a library that handles input devices for display servers and other
applications that need to directly deal with input devices.

It provides device detection, device handling, input device event processing
and abstraction so minimize the amount of custom input code the user of
libinput need to provide the common set of functionality that users expect.

Input event processing includes scaling touch coordinates, generating
pointer events from touchpads, pointer acceleration, etc.

libinput originates from weston, the Wayland reference compositor.
