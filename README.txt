libinput
========

libinput is a library that handles input devices for display servers and other
applications that need to directly deal with input devices.

It provides device detection, device handling, input device event processing
and abstraction so minimize the amount of custom input code the user of
libinput need to provide the common set of functionality that users expect.
Input event processing includes scaling touch coordinates, generating
pointer events from touchpads, pointer acceleration, etc.

libinput originates from
[weston](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/wayland/weston/), the Wayland reference
compositor.

Architecture
------------

libinput is not used directly by applications, rather it is used by the
xf86-input-libinput X.Org driver or wayland compositors. The typical
software stack for a system running Wayland is:

@dotfile libinput-stack-wayland.gv

Where the Wayland compositor may be Weston, mutter, KWin, etc. Note that
Wayland encourages the use of toolkits, so the Wayland client (your
application) does not usually talk directly to the compositor but rather
employs a toolkit (e.g. GTK) to do so.

The simplified software stack for a system running X.Org is:

@dotfile libinput-stack-xorg.gv

Again, on a modern system the application does not usually talk directly to
the X server using Xlib but rather employs a toolkit to do so.

Where possible, please provide an

device and/or the event sequence in question.
